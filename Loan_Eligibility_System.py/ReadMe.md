 Loan Eligibility System

A simple Python program that determines whether a user qualifies for a loan based on age, monthly income, and credit score.

Project Overview

The Loan Eligibility System collects user input and evaluates loan approval based on predefined business rules.

The program checks:

 Age requirement

Minimum monthly income

Credit score validity

Minimum credit score for approval

 Eligibility Rules

A loan is approved only if ALL of the following conditions are met:

Requirement	Condition
Age	21 years or older
Monthly Income	At least 1000
Credit Score Range	Between 1 and 100
Minimum Credit Score	61 or higher

If any condition fails, the loan request is rejected with a message explaining why.
