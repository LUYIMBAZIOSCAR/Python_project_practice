Project Description

The Simple Tax Calculator is a Python program that calculates the tax and remaining salary based on a user’s input salary.
It uses basic conditional logic to apply different tax rates depending on the salary range.

This project is ideal for beginners learning:

Python input/output

Conditional statements (if, elif, else)

Basic arithmetic operations

f-strings

 How the Program Works

The program prompts the user to enter their salary.

Based on the entered salary:

Below 1000 → Salary is not taxable

Between 1000 and 5000 (inclusive) → Tax rate of 10%

Above 5000 → Tax rate of 20%

The program calculates:

Tax amount

Remaining (net) salary

The results are displayed to the user.

 Tax Rules Used
